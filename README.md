# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone with the functionality of posting tweets and viewing them on the main tweeter page. Tweeter is a mobile-, tablet- and desktop-friendly app.
It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and jQuery for the front-end, and Express and Node for the back-end (back-end built by Lighthouse Labs).
